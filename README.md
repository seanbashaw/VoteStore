# VoteStore
A minecraft plugin that allows players to buy rewards by voting for their server on various sites.
This plugin will allow players to vote on various websites for their servers. By doing so, they can save their votes and use them to buy rewards.
# Why should I use this?
A different kind of currency: Currency based rewards are great for the players, but can be tedious to earn and manage. Donation based rewards help out a server, but can be seen as an unfair advantage to players who can't afford to buy items all the time. This plugin creates a good in-between balance, allowing players to vote on participating sites means servers get more exposure, and allows the players to gain unique rewards you might not be able to assign otherwise (Teleport them to a room that rains diamonds!)
Flexibility: I designed this program to be flexible. What this means is instead of using items, animals, or coordinates, I use a command-based reward system. This means you can do anything you can use a command for.
Incentive: Using this plugin gives the players on your server a reason to vote for your server, making it fun and interactive.
Reliability: As a server owner myself, I find it frustrating when plugins don't update when they say they can. That is why I promise to release an update no later than a week after the newest minecraft release.
# Requirements
This plugin uses NuVotifier (Version 2.3.5 NOT 2.3.6) to check when a player votes.
